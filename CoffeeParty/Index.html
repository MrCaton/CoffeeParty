    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>
        Sturbacks is a company created in 2020. 
        It was created in Stockholm in the neighborhood of Sodermalm. 
        There a group of coffee experts after 20 years sharing great moments drinking "Fika" 
        decided to start a new chain of low-cost coffee shops.
    </p>
    <h2>What do we do?</h2>
    <p>
        We choose the most select coffee beans and use new technologies to make a grind that keeps all the essence of the coffee.
        Afterwards, we store the ground coffee maintaining a constant temperature so that the product is not damaged.
        In our coffee stores we use the latest technology coffee makers, extracting all the flavor from our grinders.
    </p>
    <h2>Why us?</h2>
    <p>
        Although we are a young company our employees are among the most experienced in the field. 
        We are also the first company to join a technology company with one of our favorite drinks, coffee.
    </p>
    <h2>Coffee party, that's how it works!</h2>
    <p>
        The coffee parties are divided into Individuals and Business. 
        In both parties you will enjoy our best coffees accompanied by a selection of foods, 
        generally sweet, that will improve our coffee experience. 
        Coffee will be tasted in its different forms, although more emphasis will be given to espresso.
